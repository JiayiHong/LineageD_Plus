As a plant biologist:


(1) I would like to choose a default dataset, so I can visualise the tree and the cells in 3D environments.
(1b) I would like to upload a dataset (in the format of .surf), so I can see the cells in 3D environments and its basic tree.
(2) I would like to interact (rotate, scale, and clicking) in the 3D to check cells’ 3D shapes.
(3) I would like to pick the cell from 3D view and click the Supporting Cell button to mark these cells supposed to be the supporting cell.
(4) I would like to predict one level to get cells’ potential assignments.
(5) I would like to switch to the new level to see how the prediction works. 
(6) I would like to explode the embryo to see the inner structures.
(7) I would like to confirm the right pairs and unlike the wrong pairs to check the perdition results. 
(8) I would like to switch to the original level and observe from the tree to see which cells have been left.
(9) I would like to double click a cell which has not been assigned from the 3D view to target at this cell.
(10) I would like to single click its neighbours one by one from the main view to see how these two cells would combine from the Target & Sister view to traverse all its neighbours.
(11) I would like to single click the most likely sister cell and click the button: New Sister to mark the cell as the sister of the target cell.
(12) I would like to repeat the steps from 9-11 until cells in this level have been assigned to finish the assignments in this level.
(13) I would like to repeat the steps from 4-12 until the whole embryo has been checked and assigned to get the right assignments.
(14) I would like to export the assignments to get the file to my computer.
